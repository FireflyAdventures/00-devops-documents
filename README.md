# This repo contains concept document and explainers for development and operations of the App
This version is created for MLH January 2024 online hackathon with sponsorship from Google and Cloudflare.   It is based on a concept developed by elementary school teachers and tutors.  Our goal is to create an educational narrative, including relevant word problems requiring correct solution to progress to the next chapter. Adventure ends with cert by CCS to the student's teacher to reduce burden.

## This most useful document is the 1 page "GithubGuideToSystemElements20240131.ppt" which graphically portrays the system and the repositories.
